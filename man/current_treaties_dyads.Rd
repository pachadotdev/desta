  Current PTAs in Dyadic Form
}
\description{
This table does not come with the DESTA downloads. I've computed a binary
 variable that expresses if on year "Y", two countries, expressed as dyads
 in alphabetical order, have at least one valid PTA in common. This emerges
 from the fact that some countries may retire from previous trade agreements.
