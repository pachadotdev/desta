Description: The Design of Trade Agreements (DESTA) project aims to 
    systematically collect data on various types of preferential trade 
    agreements (PTAs). These may be customs unions, free trade agreements or 
    partial free trade agreements (or what economists often call economic 
    integration agreements). So far we have manually coded design features for 
    more than 710 agreements (as of October 2020). These include fine-grained 
    data with information on a large set of design features ranging from market 
    access commitments, flexibility instruments, enforcement tools, to 
    non-trade issues for the time period between 1948 and 2019.
