# desta

The goal of desta is to provide convenient access to 
The Design of Trade Agreements Database (DESTA).

## Installation

You can install the development version of desta from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("pachadotdev/desta")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to see the Chile-US dyad:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(desta)
library(dplyr)

treaties_dyads %>% 
  filter(
    country1 == "Chile",
    country2 == "United States",
    year >= 2000
  )
```

All the tables within the package are documented. Check the package
documentation from RStudio help pane.
